Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill the 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 boxes contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

You can see how you're progressing by clicking the 'Check solution' button. Incorrect guesses will be highlighted in red.

Save your game at any point with the 'save game' button and come back to finish it whenever you want to.
